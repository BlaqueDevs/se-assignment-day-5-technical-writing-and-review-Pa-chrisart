# SE-DAY5-Technical-Writing
## 1. How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
1. Know your audience
Before you take any kind of approach, you should think about who your audience is. As you get to know your stakeholders, you’ll get a sense of where they have areas of expertise and the level of their technical knowledge. This way, you won’t waste time explaining stuff they already know or that doesn’t pertain to their role. Is your audience non-techies? Is it a mix of non-technial personnel and fellow technical professionals skilled in other disciplines?

In an audience with different levels of expertise, it’s a balancing act to find the right level of information that is not too simple for more technical team members and is not too complex for those who are less technical. You’ll want to be thoughtful. It’s best to not give the impression that you are oversimplifying for specific members of your audience.

2.  Be attentive to your audience throughout your presentation
Going along with knowing your audience, as you present, be observant of body language and the overall tone of the room. You’ll quickly learn when it’s time to move on and when you need to spend more time on certain information

Whenever you share your technical know-how with a non-technical audience, the goal is to be conversational. Even if you’ve explained the technology dozens of times and know the subject matter inside and out, the people you’re currently talking to might be hearing about it for the first time. Always present with enthusiasm.

3. Incorporate storytelling when sharing technical information 
When you have a lot of data or information to share, take time to allow your audience to wrap their heads around your subject, avoiding the urge to cram every detail on a slide and just reading it aloud. 

4. Use visuals to explain technical information and processes
Written content and verbal explanations are both essential ways to communicate ideas.

However, when your goal is to simplify technical information, visualizing your concepts can be a much more effective communication medium. Why? Visual content is easier to learn and more frequently recalled than concepts learned by reading or just being told.

5. Avoid technical jargon when possible
The tech world has more than its fair share of technical jargon. Although it may be second nature for you to throw out acronyms like Google Cloud and DBMS, certain terminology may confuse or disengage the less technically savvy members of your audience. Take some time to make sure your audience understands the context of the situation.

6. Focus on impact when explaining technical concepts
Remember, information that might be fascinating to you might not be fascinating (or relevant) to your audience.

## 2. What are some strategies to tailor your content to different audience types?
Understanding Your Audience
Before you can tailor your content, you need to have a deep understanding of your target audience. Who are they? What are their interests, pain points, and goals?

- Avoid unnecessary complexity or overly simplified language that may alienate or patronize your readers.

3. Structure and Organization

- Organize your content in a logical and easy-to-follow manner.

- Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to break up long sections and improve readability.

- Consider your audience's attention span and preferences for content consumption (e.g., long-form articles, bite-sized information, visuals).

4. Examples and Analogies

- Use relatable examples and analogies that resonate with your audience's experiences and backgrounds.

- Illustrate complex concepts or abstract ideas with concrete, familiar examples.

- Ensure that your examples are relevant and meaningful to your target audience.

By adapting your writing style to align with your audience's preferences and level of understanding, you can create content that is more engaging, comprehensible, and effective.

Tailoring Content for Specific Audiences
While the principles outlined above apply to writing for any audience, it's crucial to tailor your approach further based on the specific characteristics and needs of your target readers. Here are some examples of how to tailor your content for different audiences:

## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?
To gauge the existing knowledge of your audience and avoid overwhelming them with jargon, you can use the following strategies:

1. Assess the Audience's Background
Ask questions: Start by asking simple, open-ended questions to understand their familiarity with the topic. For example, “How much experience do you have with this topic?” or “Have you worked with this concept before?”
Use a Poll or Survey: If possible, use a poll or a quick survey to gather information about their level of expertise. This can help you tailor your language and examples accordingly.
2. Start with Simple Concepts
Begin at a basic level: Even if you know your audience has some knowledge, it's often helpful to start with a simple overview. This helps you set a foundation and allows the audience to confirm their understanding early on.
Define terms upfront: Before diving into more complex ideas, take a moment to explain the key concepts or jargon in simple terms. You can introduce them gradually.
3. Use Analogies and Examples
Relate to familiar topics: Use analogies or examples from everyday life that are easy for the audience to grasp. This helps make more technical concepts relatable.
Check for feedback: After explaining something with an analogy or example, check in with your audience to see if they understood it, asking, “Does that make sense?” or “Does anyone have questions about that?”
4. Observe Reactions and Adjust
Body language or feedback cues: In a live setting, observe the body language or facial expressions of your audience. If they seem confused or lost, it’s a sign to slow down and rephrase.
Ask for feedback: After explaining a concept, ask if the audience feels comfortable with the information or if they would like more clarification. This helps you adjust your pace.
5. Use Plain Language
Avoid unnecessary jargon: If you're not sure of your audience's level, lean on simple, plain language. Save technical terms for when they’re absolutely necessary, and provide definitions when using them.
Explain as you go: If jargon is unavoidable, explain the term in context as soon as it appears.
6. Segment Your Content
Break it down into digestible chunks: Instead of delivering a large chunk of information all at once, break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This allows you to adjust based on the audience’s understanding as you go along.

## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
To ensure your content is accessible to individuals with limited technical knowledge, you can apply a variety of techniques that make complex ideas easier to understand. Here are some effective strategies:

1. Use Clear and Simple Language

Use everyday language: Opt for common, easy-to-understand words that don’t require specialized knowledge. Think about how you would explain the topic to a friend with no background in the field.
2. Define Terms and Concepts
Introduce definitions: If you do need to use technical terms, provide simple definitions and examples right after. You can include links or footnotes for those who want more detailed information.
Glossary: Include a glossary at the end of your content with definitions of key terms. This provides a resource for readers who may want to revisit and clarify concepts later.
3. Use Visual Aids
Diagrams, infographics, and charts: Visuals can break down complex concepts into more digestible pieces of information. Use simple visuals to illustrate your points or help explain processes.
Screenshots or demos: If you're discussing a tool or process, showing a screenshot or step-by-step guide can make the instructions clearer.
4. Break Down Complex Information
Use examples and analogies: Explain difficult concepts using analogies or examples that are relatable to everyday life. For example, compare a computer’s CPU to a brain, and explain its function in simple terms.
Simplify your steps: Break down complicated processes into smaller, sequential steps. Use bullet points or numbered lists to make your instructions clearer.
5. Use Formatting to Improve Readability
Headings and subheadings: Organize your content with clear headings and subheadings to make it easier to follow.
Short paragraphs: Keep paragraphs short and focused on one key point at a time to avoid overwhelming your readers.
Highlight key points: Use bold or italics to emphasize important terms or takeaways.
6. Provide Interactive Examples
Interactive demos or simulations: If possible, offer interactive tools or simple exercises that allow the audience to practice or experiment with the concepts you’re discussing. This can help them grasp the material in a more hands-on way.
Q&A sections: Include opportunities for the audience to ask questions or offer feedback, allowing them to clarify things they didn’t understand on the first go.
7. Provide Context and Background
Set the scene: Offer some background information to give context to your content. Explain why the topic matters and how it fits into a bigger picture.
Give real-world examples: Use examples from everyday life to show how the concepts you’re discussing are relevant and practical.
8. Use Analogies and Metaphors
Relatable analogies: Analogies can help make abstract or technical ideas more concrete. For instance, comparing data storage to a library with books can help non-technical users understand data management.
Metaphors: Similar to analogies, metaphors are useful tools to simplify and explain technical terms in familiar terms.
9. Offer Multi-modal Learning
Provide audio and video content: Some people may learn better by listening or watching. Consider offering videos or audio recordings explaining complex concepts in simpler terms.
Offer transcripts: If you provide video or audio content, include a transcript to help those who prefer reading or have hearing impairments.
10. Encourage Active Participation
Provide exercises: If your content is educational, include quizzes, exercises, or practice problems that let your audience engage with the material in a practical way.
Encourage questions: Create an open space for questions (such as through comments, live Q&A, or a feedback form). This gives your audience the opportunity to clarify doubts without feeling overwhelmed.
11. Provide Extra Resources for Further Learning
Link to beginner-friendly resources: Offer links to articles, tutorials, or videos that explain basic concepts in more depth. Let users know where they can learn more if they wish to.
Recommend further reading: Suggest beginner-level resources for those who are interested in deepening their knowledge.

## 5. Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?
Using plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing is important for several key reasons:

1. Improves Understanding
Clarity: Plain language ensures that your message is easily understood by a broader audience. Jargon can be confusing, especially for readers who lack specialized knowledge of the subject.

Reduces Friction: Misunderstandings caused by jargon can lead to frustration, conflict, or mistakes. By communicating in plain language, you reduce the chances of friction and build stronger, more positive relationships.

## 6. Can you provide examples of how simplifying terms (e.g., "start" instead of "initiate") improves comprehension?
Simplifying terms can significantly improve comprehension, especially when the audience is unfamiliar with technical or formal language. Here are some examples of how using simpler terms can make a difference:

1. "Start" instead of "Initiate"
Simplified Version: "Please start the process."
Complex Version: "Please initiate the process."
Why It's Better: "Start" is a basic, everyday word that most people understand immediately. "Initiate" sounds more formal and might confuse someone who isn't used to that kind of language. Simplifying it to "start" ensures that the message is clear to a wider audience without losing meaning.

2. "Use" instead of "Utilize"
Simplified Version: "You can use this tool to complete the task."
Complex Version: "You can utilize this tool to complete the task."
Why It's Better: "Use" is shorter, simpler, and more commonly understood. "Utilize" can sound more technical or formal, which might create a barrier for those who are less familiar with it.

3. "Fix" instead of "Rectify"
Simplified Version: "We need to fix the issue."
Complex Version: "We need to rectify the issue."
Why It's Better: "Fix" is a more straightforward and familiar word. "Rectify" may be understood by some, but it can feel like an unnecessary complication for others. "Fix" is quick, easy, and universally recognized.

4. "Help" instead of "Assist"
Simplified Version: "Let me help you with that."
Complex Version: "Let me assist you with that."
Why It's Better: "Help" is more casual and universally recognized, whereas "assist" can sound more formal and less approachable. The simpler word makes the speaker sound more friendly and the message easier to understand.

5. "Ask" instead of "Inquire"
Simplified Version: "Can I ask you a question?"
Complex Version: "Can I inquire about something?"
Why It's Better: "Ask" is a word we use every day, while "inquire" can sound unnecessarily formal or academic. By using "ask," you create a conversational tone that is more accessible to a wider audience.

6. "Buy" instead of "Purchase"
Simplified Version: "You can buy this item here."
Complex Version: "You can purchase this item here."
Why It's Better: While both words mean the same thing, "buy" is much more commonly used in everyday conversation. "Purchase" might be more formal and could cause some people to pause or overthink the meaning, especially in casual contexts.

7. "Try" instead of "Attempt"
Simplified Version: "Try it out and see if it works."
Complex Version: "Attempt it and observe the results."
Why It's Better: "Try" is simple and approachable, while "attempt" can sound more serious or formal. In most situations, "try" is more natural and easier to process for the reader or listener.

8. "Important" instead of "Significant"
Simplified Version: "This is an important decision."
Complex Version: "This is a significant decision."
Why It's Better: "Important" is a word everyone is familiar with and tends to be understood more easily. "Significant" is a more formal term that might require more thought and could cause confusion, especially in non-academic contexts.

9. "End" instead of "Terminate"
Simplified Version: "Please end the meeting at 3 PM."
Complex Version: "Please terminate the meeting at 3 PM."
Why It's Better: "End" is a much simpler and more widely used word than "terminate." "Terminate" sounds more technical and can feel out of place in casual communication.

10. "Show" instead of "Demonstrate"
Simplified Version: "Let me show you how to do it."
Complex Version: "Let me demonstrate how to do it."
Why It's Better: "Show" is simpler, more direct, and familiar. "Demonstrate" might sound more formal or like it requires a more structured process, which can complicate a simple instruction.

Key Benefits of Simplifying Terms:
Clarity: Simple terms are universally understood, while complex terms can cause confusion or lead to misinterpretations.
Efficiency: Shorter, simpler words get to the point quickly, saving the reader’s time and effort.
Approachability: Using plain language makes the content feel more personal and accessible, inviting more people to engage.
Reduced Cognitive Load: Readers don’t have to think too hard about what words mean, allowing them to focus on the actual content of the message.

## 7. How can using examples and visuals help in explaining complex concepts more clearly?

ChatGPT said:
Using examples and visuals can significantly enhance the clarity of complex concepts by making abstract or difficult ideas more tangible and relatable. Here’s how they help:

1. Break Down Abstract Ideas
Examples: Real-life examples put abstract concepts into context, making them easier to understand. For instance, explaining the concept of "networking" in computing could be confusing, but by using the example of people talking to each other at a party, it becomes much clearer.
Visuals: Diagrams, charts, or infographics translate complex information into something concrete. For example, a flowchart showing the steps in a process or a graph illustrating data trends allows the viewer to grasp patterns or relationships quickly.
2. Engage Multiple Senses
Examples: By providing examples, you cater to the audience’s understanding through storytelling or relatable situations. These can engage the reader’s imagination and make the content more memorable. For example, explaining how a car engine works might be difficult in words alone, but showing an example of how various engine components work together simplifies the explanation.
Visuals: Visuals like images, videos, and diagrams offer an additional layer of understanding for visual learners. Seeing a concept illustrated in action can help reinforce what is explained in text. For example, showing how a cell divides with an animation can make the process clearer than just reading a description.
3. Increase Retention
Examples: By grounding the material in real-life or familiar contexts, examples make the content more memorable. People tend to remember stories, experiences, or familiar scenarios better than abstract concepts. For instance, explaining the importance of budgeting using the example of managing a household’s finances helps readers relate personally, which improves retention.
Visuals: Visual aids help create lasting mental images. Our brains are wired to remember images better than text alone. For instance, infographics condense and clarify large amounts of information in ways that text-heavy explanations cannot. A visual timeline of historical events helps people better recall the order of events than if they read about it.
4. Clarify Relationships and Processes
Examples: Examples allow you to show how different elements interact with each other in a way that makes sense. For example, when explaining how supply and demand affect pricing, a real-world example—such as how the price of concert tickets fluctuates based on the number of people interested—can make the concept clearer.
Visuals: Diagrams, flowcharts, and schematics show the relationships between concepts, illustrating connections that might be hard to explain with words alone. For example, a Venn diagram can easily show the overlap between different concepts, making it clear which areas they share or where they differ.
5. Simplify Complex Data
Examples: When explaining statistics or complex data, using relatable examples can simplify the information. For example, instead of saying "There was a 20% increase in sales," you could explain this with an example, like "If your business sold 100 products last month, that means you sold 20 more products this month."
Visuals: Graphs, bar charts, and pie charts can turn raw data into clear visuals that highlight important trends, comparisons, or patterns. This helps the audience quickly digest large amounts of information and draw conclusions without needing to analyze the data themselves.
6. Increase Accessibility
Examples: Examples cater to different learning styles and levels of understanding. A beginner-friendly example can make a technical concept more accessible, and then you can gradually introduce more complex examples as needed.
Visuals: Visuals can bridge language barriers, as images and diagrams can often convey meaning more universally than words. For example, showing a picture of a machine part and labeling its components is more accessible than explaining each part with technical language alone.
7. Encourage Active Learning
Examples: By using examples, you encourage active engagement with the content. People are more likely to understand when they can apply a concept to real-world situations. Asking the audience to think of their own examples also helps reinforce learning.
Visuals: Interactive visuals, such as clickable diagrams, videos, or even interactive simulations, allow learners to experiment with the concept themselves. This type of learning encourages a deeper understanding through practice.
8. Build Confidence
Examples: Giving examples helps the audience feel more confident in their understanding. It demonstrates how the concept can be applied in real life, showing that it’s not just theoretical but something they can grasp and use themselves.
Visuals: Clear visuals provide a reference point for the audience, allowing them to revisit and reinforce their understanding. Visual aids also reduce confusion, making people feel more assured that they are following along correctly.

Example: Instead of reading through long paragraphs, headings and subheadings help readers see at a glance what each section is about.
2. Improve Scannability
Why it Works: Technical documents often contain a lot of information, so readers tend to skim to find the most relevant sections. Headings and subheadings allow them to quickly locate the information they need.
Benefit: Readers don’t have to read every line—headings and subheadings let them find the exact section they’re interested in and understand the structure of the content at a glance.
Example: In a manual, if someone is looking for troubleshooting steps, they can quickly scan for a heading like "Troubleshooting" or "Common Issues."
3. Enhance Comprehension
Why it Works: Headings and subheadings provide context to the content that follows, helping readers anticipate what each section will cover. This makes the information easier to digest.
Benefit: By highlighting key topics, headings act as signposts that guide readers through complex material, making it easier to absorb and understand the main ideas.
Example: A heading like "System Requirements" tells the reader that the content under it will provide specific technical details about the system setup, creating a framework for easier understanding.
4. Create a Logical Flow
Why it Works: Headings and subheadings ensure that content is logically organized, with a clear progression from one idea to the next. This structure helps maintain the narrative of the document, ensuring that topics are introduced in a coherent order.
Benefit: This organized approach minimizes confusion and makes the document more readable, as readers can follow the progression of information in a natural way.
Example: In a software guide, starting with "Introduction," followed by "Installation," then "Configuration," and finishing with "Troubleshooting" ensures a smooth flow for the reader.
5. Highlight Key Topics and Subtopics
Why it Works: Headings and subheadings highlight the main topics and subtopics of a document, making it clear what each section covers. This helps readers quickly identify what’s important.
Benefit: By breaking content into digestible sub-sections, readers can focus on one topic at a time, which is particularly helpful in technical documents where too much detail can become overwhelming.
Example: In a product manual, having headings like "Product Features," "Safety Precautions," and "User Instructions" allows the reader to focus on specific sections based on their needs.
6. Aid in Referencing and Navigation
Why it Works: When technical documents are organized with headings and subheadings, it’s easier to reference and find specific sections. This is particularly helpful for documents with a lot of content or detailed information.
Benefit: A table of contents that includes headings and subheadings allows the reader to quickly jump to the relevant section, improving navigation. It’s especially helpful when readers are looking for specific details without having to read the entire document.
Example: If a user is troubleshooting a specific error, they can look up "Error Codes" in the table of contents and jump directly to the relevant section.
7. Improve Visual Appeal
Why it Works: A well-structured document with clear headings and subheadings looks more inviting and less intimidating. This visual appeal helps reduce reader fatigue, making them more likely to engage with the content.
Benefit: Breaking up the content with headings also makes it appear more organized and less text-heavy, which encourages the reader to keep reading.
Example: Instead of a long block of text explaining a complex concept, subheadings help break the content into smaller sections, making it visually easier to navigate.
8. Enhance SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
Why it Works: In online technical documents, headings and subheadings are used by search engines to index content. Using relevant keywords in headings improves the document’s visibility when users search for specific information.
Benefit: By structuring your document with proper headings, you can increase its chances of ranking higher in search results, making it more discoverable for users seeking technical help or information.
Example: A user searching for “How to configure a server” will be more likely to find a document with a heading like "Server Configuration Steps" than one without clearly defined headings.
9. Guide the Reader’s Focus
Why it Works: Headings and subheadings help the reader focus on the most important points. They act as signposts that prioritize key topics, so the reader knows where to pay attention.
Benefit: In technical writing, where the content can be dense, headings allow you to emphasize the most critical aspects, so readers don’t miss key details.
Example: In a troubleshooting guide, headings like "Step 1: Check Connections" and "Step 2: Restart the System" guide the reader through the process, ensuring they don’t skip any critical steps.
10. Facilitate Collaboration
Why it Works: In collaborative projects or documents, headings and subheadings help divide work into clearly defined sections. Team members can easily see what parts of the document they need to focus on or contribute to.
Benefit: This organization ensures that all aspects of the document are covered and helps teams work together more efficiently.
Example: A technical manual with headings for "Introduction," "Installation," and "Configuration" allows different team members to take responsibility for different sections of the content.
Summary:
Headings and subheadings are essential for improving the readability and organization of technical documents because they:

Provide a clear structure and logical flow.
Make content easier to scan and navigate.
Improve comprehension by setting context for each section.
Help readers focus on key topics and subtopics.
Increase visual appeal and reduce text overload.
Aid in referencing, accessibility, and SEO.

## 10. What are some best practices for creating effective headings and subheadings?
Creating effective headings and subheadings is essential for improving the clarity, readability, and organization of technical documents. Here are some best practices to ensure that your headings and subheadings serve their purpose effectively:

1. Use Clear and Descriptive Language
What to Do: Make sure headings clearly reflect the content of the section. They should give readers a quick idea of what the section is about, without being overly vague or technical.
Why: Clear and descriptive headings make it easier for readers to understand the section’s topic at a glance and navigate the document efficiently.
Example: Instead of a heading like "Overview," use something more specific like "System Architecture Overview."
2. Be Concise
What to Do: Keep headings short and to the point. Use as few words as necessary to convey the core idea of the section.
Why: Concise headings make it easier to scan and reduce clutter. They should be easy to read at a glance without requiring the reader to digest long, complex phrases.
Example: Instead of "The process of installing and setting up the software," use "Software Installation."
3. Maintain Consistency in Style
What to Do: Use a consistent style for headings and subheadings throughout the document. This includes font size, type (e.g., bold or italic), and formatting (e.g., numbered or bulleted lists for sections).
Why: Consistency in heading style ensures a cohesive structure and helps readers easily recognize sections and subsections, improving navigation.
Example: If you use bold text for main headings, ensure all main headings throughout the document are bold.
4. Use Parallel Structure
What to Do: Ensure that all headings in a list or sequence follow a similar grammatical structure (e.g., starting each heading with a verb or noun).
Why: This creates uniformity and makes headings feel related, improving readability and helping the reader focus on the content rather than the inconsistencies in phrasing.
Example: Instead of mixing "Understanding the system" and "Install the software," use "Understanding the System" and "Installing the Software" for a consistent verb-based structure.
5. Incorporate Keywords
What to Do: Use relevant keywords in your headings that clearly indicate the topic. If applicable, use terms your target audience would search for or recognize.
Why: Keywords help readers quickly identify if the section contains the information they’re looking for, and they can also improve the document's SEO (search engine optimization) if it's online.
Example: "Setting up Network Security Protocols" is better than just "Setting up Protocols" because it includes the key term “network security.”
6. Use Hierarchical Formatting
What to Do: Organize headings and subheadings hierarchically to establish a clear structure. Use larger, bold text for main headings and progressively smaller text for subheadings.
Why: A clear hierarchy helps readers distinguish between major topics and smaller subtopics, improving navigation and understanding of the document’s structure.
Example:
Main heading: "System Installation"
Subheading: "Installing Dependencies"
Sub-subheading: "System Requirements"
7. Avoid Overloading with Jargon
What to Do: Keep headings simple and avoid using too much technical jargon, especially for non-expert audiences.
Why: Overly technical headings can confuse or alienate readers who may not be familiar with the terminology. Instead, use plain language whenever possible.
Example: Instead of "Automating Scripting Protocols with Cron Jobs," use "Automating Tasks Using Cron Jobs."
8. Be Specific When Necessary
What to Do: Use specific headings that pinpoint the exact content of the section, especially in lengthy documents where broad headings could cause confusion.
Why: Specific headings help readers quickly find the exact information they need without having to read through unnecessary sections.
Example: Instead of just "Troubleshooting," use "Troubleshooting Common Installation Errors."
9. Use Actionable Headings When Appropriate
What to Do: When the section involves instructions, processes, or steps, try to phrase the heading as an action that describes what the reader will do or learn.
Why: Actionable headings are clearer and more engaging, as they tell the reader exactly what they can expect to do in that section.
Example: Instead of "Installation Requirements," use "How to Install the Software."
10. Incorporate Numbers or Bullet Points for Step-by-Step Sections
What to Do: For procedural or step-by-step instructions, use numbered headings or bulleted lists to indicate sequential tasks or actions.
Why: This makes it easier for readers to follow instructions and ensures they can track their progress through a process.
Example: "Step 1: Install Dependencies" and "Step 2: Configure System Settings" create a clear progression.
11. Test for Clarity
What to Do: Review your headings to ensure they clearly convey the content of each section. Ask someone unfamiliar with the material to check if the headings make sense to them.
Why: Testing your headings helps ensure that they’re effective in guiding the reader. If an outsider can understand your headings, it’s a good sign they are clear and appropriate.
Example: A user should be able to look at a heading like “Understanding Data Security” and immediately know what content they can expect in that section.
12. Avoid Long Sentences
What to Do: Keep headings and subheadings short, preferably to a single phrase or clause. Avoid full sentences unless absolutely necessary.
Why: Long headings can be overwhelming and hard to read. They should serve as a brief preview of the section’s content without requiring too much cognitive effort from the reader.
Example: Instead of "The process of configuring the database for optimal performance," use "Configuring the Database for Performance."
